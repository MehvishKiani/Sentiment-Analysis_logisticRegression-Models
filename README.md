# Sentiment-Analysis_logisticRegression-Models
 Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The analysis is performed on a dataset named "logistic_features.csv," which is loaded from Google Drive. The models are trained, evaluated, and compared based on accuracy and classification reports.
 
Repository Name: Sentiment-Analysis-Models

Description: This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis using two different models: Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The analysis is performed on a dataset named "logistic_features.csv," which is loaded from Google Drive. The models are trained, evaluated, and compared based on accuracy and classification reports.

Logistic Regression Model
Trains a Logistic Regression classifier using the lbfgs solver for multinomial classification.
Features include bias, positive, and negative sentiments.
Achieves accuracy and classification report on the test data.
Multinomial Naive Bayes Model
Implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis.
Utilizes the same feature set (bias, positive, negative) for training and evaluation.
Outputs accuracy and classification report for model assessment.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MehvishKiani/Sentiment-Analysis-Models.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to analyze sentiment using both models.

Dataset
The dataset, "logistic_features.csv," is stored in the Google Drive path specified in the code.
